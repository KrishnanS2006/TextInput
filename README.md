# TextInput Class For Pygame
Have you ever thought about having a text box or text input for Pygame? This is it! I coded this class by myself so that anyone can incorporate a text input into pygame.

To set up a Text Input, first save the text_input.py file and put it in the same directory. Next, import it and create a new instance of the TextInput Class for every text box you need. Every Text Input will have its own Cursor, which blinks to show the position of typing.
